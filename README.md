# systema

`ˈsɪstəma/`

## Installation

Make sure you have [yarn] installed, then:

```
git clone git@github.com:wercker/systema.git
cd systema
yarn
```

## Development

Run `yarn dev` then open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Build

Run `yarn build`. The built files are in the `build` directory but the entire
source dir should be deployed as the source files are still used for server
render.

With the files built the server can be started with `yarn start`.
